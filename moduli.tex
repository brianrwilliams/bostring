\section{Deformations of the theory and string backgrounds}

\owen{Maybe the Gelfand-Fuk discussion can be anticipated in Section 1? I think versions of it are easy to motivate: ``We want to study Lagrangian densities, which are functions on jets of fields. Hence the simplest case is to consider functions on jets at a point, which we recognize as a version of Gelfand-Fuks \dots'' Then we invoke that discussion to work with formal vector fields and simply quote~GF.}

\owen{We should observe that we see the deformations of the action, such as $B$-fields and dilatons. Observe we've rediscovered "string backgrounds."}

\brian{Might be good to hint at the curved sigma model here.}
