@article{Losev2006,
abstract = {We consider the first order formalism in string theory, providing a new off-shell description of the nontrivial backgrounds around an " infinite metric " . The OPE of the vertex operators, corresponding to the background fields in some " twistor representation " , and conditions of conformal invariance results in the quadratic equation for the background fields, which appears to be equivalent to the Einstein equations with a Kalb-Ramond B-field and a dilaton. Using a new representation for the Einstein equations with B-field and dilaton we find a new class of solutions including the plane waves for metric (graviton) and the B-field. We discuss the properties of these background equations and main features of the BRST operator in this approach.},

@article{Lian1992,
abstract = {Motivated by the descent equation in string theory, we give a new interpretation for the action of the symmetry charges on the BRST cohomology in terms of what we call the Gerstenhaber bracket. This bracket is compatible with the graded commutative product in cohomology, and hence gives rise to a new class of examples of what mathematicians call a Gerstenhaber algebra. The latter structure was first discussed in the context of Hochschild cohomology theory [11]. Off-shell in the (chiral) BRST complex, all the identities of a Gerstenhaber algebra hold up to homotopy. Applying our theory to the c=1 model, we give a precise conceptual description of the BRST-Gerstenhaber algebra of this model. We are led to a direct connection between the bracket structure here and the anti-bracket formalism in BV theory [29]. We then discuss the bracket in string backgrounds with both the left and the right movers. We suggest that the homotopy Lie algebra arising from our Gerstenhaber bracket is closely related to the HLA recently constructed by Witten-Zwiebach. Finally, we show that our constructions generalize to any topological conformal field theory.},

@article{Witten2013,
abstract = {It has long been known that in principle, the genus g vacuum amplitude for bosonic strings or superstrings in 26 or 10 dimensions can be entirely determined from conditions of holomorphy. Moreover, this has been done in practice for bosonic strings of low genus. Here we describe in a unified way how to determine the bosonic string and superstring vacuum amplitude in genus 1 and 2 via holomorphy. The main novelty is the superstring analysis in genus 2, where we use holomorphy to get a new understanding of some of the results that previously have been obtained by more explicit calculations.},
