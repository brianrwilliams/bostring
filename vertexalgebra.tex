\section{OPE and the string vertex algebra}

\brian{Write down vertex algebra from quantization above. Possibly state the relationship to semi-infinite cohomology}

\begin{prop} Let $\Obs^q$ be the factorization algebra on $\Sigma = \CC$ of the holomorphic bosonic string. The factorization product of open disks $D \subset \CC$ determines the structure of a vertex algebra (see Proposition \ref{prop book vertex} below) on the cohomology of the factorization algebra on an open disk $H^*(\Obs^q(D))$, that we denote $\Vert(\Obs^q)$. Moreover, there is an isomorphism of vertex algebras
\ben
\Phi : V^{\rm string} \xto{\cong} \Vert(\Obs^q) .
\een
\end{prop}

\owen{I believe these vertex algebras are cohomologically graded, unless we're lucky and the cohomology all sits in degree zero. In which case, we should point out this miracle. Perhaps better would be to extract the dg vertex algebra.}

\owen{Do you know a citation where the string vertex algebra is already written down? Of course it's almost explicit in any discussion of the ``modern''/BRST quantization of the bosonic string, where they write down $Q$, which ought to be the differential of the dg vertex algebra using our construction.}

\brian{How deformations discussed in Section 3 gives explicit deformations of the the vertex algebra.}
