\section{OPE and the string vertex algebra}

Vertex algebras are mathematical objects that axiomatize the behavior of local observables 
(i.e., point-like observables) of a chiral conformal field theory (CFT),
such as the $bc\beta\gamma$ system or the holomorphic bosonic string.
The vertex operator of a vertex algebras encodes the operator product expansions (OPE) for local observables,
which is of central interest in understanding a chiral CFT.
(We will not review vertex algebras here
as there are many nice expositions \owen{cite some}.)

In this section we will explain how to extract the vertex algebra of the holomorphic bosonic string,
using machinery developed in~\cite{CG1,LiVA,CDO}.
The answer we recover is precisely the chiral sector of the usual bosonic string.
\owen{Is that true?}

\subsection{Some context}

In the BV formalism one constructs a cochain complex of observables,
for both the classical and the quantized theory, if it exists.
The cochain complexes are local on the source manifold of a theory:
on each open set $U$ in that manifold~$\Sigma$,
one can pick out the observables with support in~$U$ by asking for the observables that vanish on fields with support outside~$U$.
It is the central result of~\cite{CG1,CG2} that the observables also satisfy a local-to-global property,
akin to the sheaf gluing axiom,
and hence form a {\em factorization algebra} on~$\Sigma$.

We will not need that general notion here.
Instead, we will use vertex algebras.
Theorem~\owen{???} of~\cite{CG1} explains how a certain class of factorization algebras (living on $\Sigma = \CC$) yields a vertex algebra by an explicit construction.
It assures us that the factorization algebra of a chiral CFT determines a vertex algebra.

In particular, Section~\owen{???} of~\cite{CG1} examines the free $\beta\gamma$ system in great detail.
Its main result is that the well-known $\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra is recovered by the two-step process of BV quantization, which yields a factorization algebra, and then the extraction of a vertex algebra.

The exact same arguments apply to the free $bc\beta\gamma$ system,
and we obtain the following.

\begin{prop}
\owen{State the $bc\beta\gamma$ VOA. Mention the classical (=associated graded) observables are a Poisson vertex algebra.}
\end{prop}

\subsection{The case of the string}

The holomorphic bosonic string is a chiral CFT and so the machinery of~\cite{CG1} applies to it.
One can extract a vertex algebra directly by this method.
But Li's work

\brian{Write down vertex algebra from quantization above. Possibly state the relationship to semi-infinite cohomology}

\begin{prop} 
Let $\Obs^q$ be the factorization algebra on $\Sigma = \CC$ of the holomorphic bosonic string. The factorization product of open disks $D \subset \CC$ determines the structure of a vertex algebra (see Proposition \ref{prop book vertex} below) on the cohomology of the factorization algebra on an open disk $H^*(\Obs^q(D))$, that we denote $\Vert(\Obs^q)$. Moreover, there is an isomorphism of vertex algebras
\ben
\Phi : V^{\rm string} \xto{\cong} \Vert(\Obs^q) .
\een
\end{prop}

\owen{I believe these vertex algebras are cohomologically graded, unless we're lucky and the cohomology all sits in degree zero. In which case, we should point out this miracle. Perhaps better would be to extract the dg vertex algebra.}

\owen{Do you know a citation where the string vertex algebra is already written down? Of course it's almost explicit in any discussion of the ``modern''/BRST quantization of the bosonic string, where they write down $Q$, which ought to be the differential of the dg vertex algebra using our construction.}

\owen{Si's theorem gives us a nice approach: we conjugate the free $bc\beta\gamma$ vertex algebra by the appropriate VOA automorphism to recover the string. This may be close to what physicists do anyway.}

\brian{How deformations discussed in Section 3 gives explicit deformations of the the vertex algebra.}
