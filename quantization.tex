\section{Quantizing the holomorphic bosonic string on a disk} 

\brian{Gauge fixing condition. The theory is finite, no counterterms. Review Gelfand-Fuksy stuff. Local local deformation complex calculation. Do the anomaly calculation to obtain $\dim_{\CC} = 13$. Argue why this produces a quantization on any source Riemann surface.}

\owen{I'm not sure what is the optimal order: diagrams then cohomology group, or other way? If we do the concrete Feynman diagrams and show that something vanishes exactly when you'd expect from the literature, then people might feel assured. However, it's not clear where this anomaly lives until you do the obstruction-deformation computation. Perhaps we just indicate how the reader can pick her preferred order.}
